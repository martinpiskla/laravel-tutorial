Laravel notes

Artisan file - command line application (helps with artisan/composer commands during laravel development)

Routes - self explanatory - registers what has to be presented to client 
after they navigate to a (sub)page

Views - actual html pages presented to client

Controller - class which determines what happens when user visits specific Route
